# Progress Log

## Day 1: 22/April/2023
1. Collect the dataset of real estate properties with their corresponding sale prices.
2. Explore the dataset and identify missing values, outliers, and other potential preprocessing steps.
3. Begin preprocessing the data by handling missing values and engineering new features as necessary.

# Day 2
1. Continue preprocessing the data, focusing on encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric data.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets using scikit-learn.
3. Begin training a machine learning model on the training data, experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameters.

# Day 3
1. Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing data, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
2. Iterate on the model training process as necessary, adjusting algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve better performance.
3. Begin building a Docker image that contains the entire machine learning pipeline, including the trained model and all necessary dependencies.

# Day 4
1. Complete building the Docker image and ensure that it can run correctly on a local machine.
2. Begin deploying the Docker image to a cloud service Amazon Web Services
3. Iterate on the deployment process as necessary, ensuring that the image can be scaled and updated as needed.

# Day 5
1. Finalize the deployment process and ensure that the machine learning pipeline is running smoothly in the cloud.
2. Prepare documentation and instructions for future users to be able to reproduce the project and build on it as necessary.
3. Submit the final project to GitHub and celebrate!
